**Assignment title:** QSAR Data Curation and Bioactivity Dataset Preparation for p53 Cancer Mutant Y220C 
The objective of this assignment was to retrieve, curate, and preprocess bioactivity data suitable for Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling. Emphasis was placed on ensuring data quality, reproducibility, and compliance with standard cheminformatics workflows.
**Selected target name:** p53 cancer mutant Y220C (in complex with MB184)
**Number of Bioactivity records**: 1819
**Short Description of the Data Curation Workflow**
Bioactivity data were programmatically retrieved from the ChEMBL database using the chembl_webresource_client. IC₅₀ activity records for the KRAS target were filtered, standardized, cleaned, and curated to remove missing values, invalid SMILES, and inconsistent measurements. The final curated dataset is structured and suitable for downstream QSAR modeling and machine-learning analysis.
